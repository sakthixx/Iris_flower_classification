# Iris_flower_classification 
This machine learning model can learn from the specified input (measurements) of the iris species and classifies the variants according to it.
Iris flower has three species:
(A) Setosa 
(B) Versicolor
(C) Virginica
where all the three variants differs according to their measurements. So a machine learning model has been created here that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them. Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification.
