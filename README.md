# Iris_flower_classification
This machine learning model can learn from the specified input (measurements) of the iris species and classifies the variants according to it.
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them. Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification.
